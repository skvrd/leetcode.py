Python solutions to **Leetcode** problems

## Project
This project consists of __Leetcode__ problems I solved, with some of my thoughts around a solution.
Any comments or PRs with better solutions are very welcome.

## Structure

This repo has folder `problems`, which contains folders with IDs of problems from [**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com/).
Each folder contains `solution.py` file with actual solution to the problem and `.md` file with problem statement, link to the original problem and some of my thoughts on how to solve this problem.

## Motivation
Motivation behind this project is following:
1. Become a better programmer, by solving more and more tricky problems from LeetCode
2. Become a better writer, since I will practice a lot with putting my thoughts on "virtual" paper.
3. Get to the top 1000 of **Leetcode** programmers by participating at [**Leetcode** contests](https://leetcode.com/contest/)
4. Make my GitHub more active.
